    story:
      "Our company was born from a genuine passion for cars combined with the excitement of international trade. As car industry experts and enthusiasts ourselves, we quickly realized that Dubai offers an exceptionally high-quality selection of vehicles and parts – but exporting them to Europe is challenging without the right connections and know-how.\n\nWe've built direct relationships with trusted sellers and service providers in Dubai, ensuring every product's origin and condition are thoroughly verified. We work only with reliable shipping partners and maintain close cooperation with customs authorities to make the process smooth.\n\nWe operate flexibly – our customers include car enthusiasts looking for something special and unique, car dealerships wanting to stand out with a distinctive selection, and businesses seeking cost-effective spare parts solutions.\n\nCustomer satisfaction is our most important measure of success. The idea was born in Finland – but our focus is on the global car market.",
